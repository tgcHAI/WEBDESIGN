## Week 5: Milestone 1 - HTML and CSS Template (Submission)

**Status: Complete**

This project represents the completed submission for Milestone 1. The initial version was reviewed by our instructor, and the following improvements have been made based on the provided feedback to enhance the project's quality and completeness.

* **Improved CSS Organization:** The `style.css` file has been refactored for better readability and maintenance. The code is now structured into logical sections using comments (e.g., `/* --- Header & Navigation --- */`), as recommended.

* **Completed Missing CSS Styles:** All necessary styles for the `calculator.html` page have been added. This includes implementing the grid layouts for `.expenses-grid` and `.summary__grid`, and styling all form and summary components to match the project wireframe.

* **Added Project README:** This `README.md` file was created to provide a clear overview of the project, its goals, features, and team members, fulfilling a key requirement of the submission.

These changes address all feedback points and bring the project to a polished and complete state for Milestone 1.
